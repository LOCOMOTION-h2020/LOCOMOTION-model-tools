In this repository you can find WILIAM v1.2 BETA, under Licence MIT.

This version is not a fully validated model and hence it is not possible to use the whole model with confidence. The core developer team will continue developing the model and release updates in the close future. If you have any comment, question or detect any bug, please report them to info.wiliam@uva.es.
